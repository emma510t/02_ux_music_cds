# 02 Mandatory Assignment: Music CDs

this is a school project

## Task

Create an in-memory front-end application where the user can add music CDs to a table and delete them from it.

- No permanent data structure is necessary. The data will be simply stored in the table, thus disappearing upon reload.

The following alternatives to add elements to the DOM could be explored:

- createElement()
- innerHTML with template literals
- cloneNode()
